Thank you for installing gpu-fleet!

Metrics are exposed on the service {{ include "gpu-fleet.controllerName" . }} port {{ .Values.controller.metricsPort }}.

If monitoring.enabled=true, a ServiceMonitor has been created for Prometheus Operator.

Use the kubectl plugin installed via krew to interact with runs:
  kubectl runs --state <state-file> plan <run-name>
